# Personal Website in Vite

A recreation of [my personal website](https://github.com/dairefinn/dairefinn.github.io) using the Vite framework and React.

This serves as a learning experience for me to familiarize myself with React, having not used it since college when I used Expo to create a mobile app for my third year project.
