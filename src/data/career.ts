    description: `
        I started my degree in computing at ATU Sligo. I chose this course because I had always been interested in computers and technology.
        This course also offered a nice divide between software and networking to begin with, after which you could elect to focus on one or the other.
        <br/><br/>
        My father works in networking so I decided to take the software route as I had already picked up plenty of knowledge from him regarding networking.
        <br/><br/>
        I feel like the course laid a good foundation for me and I learned a lot of the basics of software development.
        <br/><br/>
        More importantly, I met many new friends who I regularly discuss tech with and bounce ideas off of to this day.

        Due to the pandemic, Frankli saw a huge increase in demand for our platform as more and more companies were forced to go remote. This resulted in us having enough funding to expand the team and start working on some bigger projects.
        <br/><br/>
        We had grown to a team of 5 developers so to help keep everything coordinated I took the lead on utilizing the full Atlassian suite to manage our projects.

        Our platform was growing rapidly and we were getting more and more clients.
        <br/><br/>
        The larger team size meant that we could focus on more varied projects and I got to work with some really interesting technologies. I learned a lot from my colleagues during this time and I feel like I grew a lot as a developer.
        <br/><br/>
        One project I enjoyed was overhauling our pipelines to be faster and more reliable. I achieved this by splitting them into more manageable steps, running steps in parallel, utilizing a cache and creating a custom Docker image for our build environment.

        This involved going remote first and downsizing the team to just one executive and a one developer.

        I was offered and accepted the developer position, meaning I was now responsible for the entire codebase and was the point of contact for any technical queries.

        I also took on a mentoring role for our graduate developer who had elected to stay on part-time.

        The first project I worked on was to implement a new sign-up workflow. I learned a lot about browser compatibility from this project because we needed to support older versions of Internet Explorer.
